	The first step in identifying breast cancer requires inspection of mammogram scans to find existence of lesion and its pathology as Benign/Malignant. With a lot of women having high probability of breast cancer it will be really helpful to radiologists if we can help speed up this process of inspecting mammograms to find lesions and their nature. Use of deep learning methods to identify lesions can significantly help and support the current radiologists. We use various deep learning methods with residual connections and transfer learning approaches for this classification task. In addition to some very popularly known architectures, we've experimented with our very own custom deep CNN architecture which performs better than a few of them. We also show heatmaps with bounding box highlighting the Region of Interest ROI.
